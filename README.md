<h1>16_bit_adder_subtractor</h1><br>
<p>It's a calculator designed to find the sum and difference (in 2's complement form) of two 16-bit numbers.</p><br>

<p>Here's the circuit for the 16-bit adder and subtractor:</p><br>

<p>To use the circuit as an adder, set the adder/subtractor control pin (M) to 0</p><br>
<p>To use the circuit as a subtractor use the adder/subtractor pin as 1</p><br>
<b></b><p>You can see the final output at 7 segment displays</p><br></b>
